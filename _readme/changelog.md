##### WordPress 5.0 Ready!

+ **Tested with WordPress core 5.0 (Gutenberg)!**
+ Editor Blocks: Course and Lesson layouts are now (preferrably) powered by various editor blocks.
+ When a block is added to a course or lesson, the template hook that automatically outputs that element is removed automatically (preventing duplicates).
+ If you use the LifterLMS Labs: Action Manager you may no longer need it!
+ Course & Membership instructors are now managed through an editor "plugin". Check out the rocket icon near the "Publish/Update" button.
+ Instructor metabox will load conditionally based on presence of the block editor
+ New courses and lessons will automatically have a preloaded block editor template
+ Courses and lessons will automatically be "migrated" to these templates when edited on the admin panel
+ Various course settings conditionally load based on the presence of the block editor
+ Added filter to the headline size in the `course/meta-wrapper-start.php` template. Allows customization of headline via the "Course Information" block settings.
+ If you're not ready for WordPress 5.0 you can still upgrade LifterLMS. This release is fully functional without the block editor.
